	- Search for Files
$find -name <"file_name"> # in current directory
$find -name <"file_name*"> # in current directory - show all with that word in their name
$find -iname <"file_name"> # in current directory, ignore case sensitivity(name, NAME, NaMe)
$find -not -name <"file_name"> # in current directory, all files that are not file_name
$find / -type d -name <"name"> 2>/dev/null # search for directories (with -type - to search for links, devices, etc.) in the whole 
system and show only the results(stderr goes to dev/null)
$find / -name <"file_name"> # in all system
$find / -name <"file_name"> 2>/dev/null # filter out all errors
$find / -name <"file_name"> 2>&1 | grep -v "some_error" # sends stderr to stdout and then filters to not show a specific error 
$find / -type f -name "*.log" # all files ending in .log
$find -size +1M # all files larger than 1 MB (M=MB, k=kb, c=byte)
$find -type f -mtime +1 # files older than one day (-1 - from today, -50 - last 50 days)
$find -user <user_name> # all files of a user
$find -user <user_name> | more # all files of a user/show screen by screen
$find -perm 644 # all files with permissions rw-r-r
$find -name <"filepw_name"> -exec chmod 700 {} \; # find file and execute command (e.g. chmod)
$locate <file_name> # less powerful and flexible than find, depends on a database that might not be updated, to update use $updatedb
$which python # tells which version of a program is going to be executed and its directory
$which ifconfig # tells which version of a program is going to be executed and its directory

	- Compare and Manipulate File Content and Use Input-Output Redirection
$cat <file_name> | more # show content from file beginning
$sort <file_name> # sort content alphabetically
$cat <file_name> <file_name> | sort
$cat <file_name> <file_name> | sort > <combined_file>
$fmt -u file_name # format text  (cleans spaces, ..?) /on screen - do not saves the format
$nl file_name # shows number of lines
$nl file_name > new_file # create new file with numbered lines
$cut -d "<symbol>" -f1 file_name # show everything before the delimiting symbol (or -f2 - after it)
$<command> > new_file # create file and insert output of command

	- Analyze Text Using Basic Regular Expressions
^ and $ - anchor characters (^ starting, $ ending); period (.) - special character means any character
$grep '^ball' file_name # search for every line starting with ball 
$grep 'ball$' file_name # search for every line ending with ball 
$grep 'ball' file_name # search for every line with ball
$grep '^.$' file_name # search for every line having only one character 
$grep '^..$' file_name # search for every line having only two characters 
$grep '^[0-9]or [A-Z]or [a-z]or [7]' file_name# search for line starting with all digits or all capital letters or 7 or â€¦. (not at once)
$grep '^[A-Z, d]' file_name 
?? grep '[Feb] [ls]' test_file
$grep '^T[a-z][^e]' file_name # the two carrots(^) are different - first search in beginning of line, second means a character that is not 'e'
$grep '^[a-z]*' # any word starting with zero or more letters
$grep '[a-z]\{4,8\}' # any word with 4 to 8 letters

	- Archive, Backup, Compress, Unpack, and Decompress Files
$cp /source /destination # copy just files!
$cp -rf /source /destination # copy all files with dir and subdir
$tar cvf new_file.tar /source # create archive, not compressed (c-new file, v - verbose, tell what is happening, f- store to a single file)
$tar tvf new_file.tar # list files in archive
$tar tvf new_file.tar | grep # search in archive
$gzip new_file.tar # compress an archive
$gzip random_file # compress any file
$gunzip random_file # decompress any file
$tar cvfz new_file.tar.gz /source # archive and compress
$tar xvfz new_file.tar.gz # extract compressed archive (x-extract, v - verbose, f- file, z - zipped)

	- Create, Delete, Copy, and Move Files and Directories
touch, cp, pwd, mkdir, mv, rm, rmdir, rm -rf, 
$mkdir -p dir1/dir2/dir3 # make dir and sub dirs

	- Create and Manage Hard and Soft Links
$ln /source link_name # make a hardlink to a file
$ln -s /source link_name # make a symbolic link to a file

 - List, Set, and Change Standard File Permissions
$ll = ls -l # files with info
$ls - la # hidden files as well
$chmod u+rwx <file> # user has rwx
$chmod g-rwx o-rwx <file> # group and all get no rwx
$chmod a+rwx <file> # all get rwx
$chmod 644 <file> # user get rw, group and all get r // 4-read, 2-write, 1-exec
$chmod 755 <directory> # FOR DIRECTORY w-vreate files in directory, x-open directory, r-list content

 - Read, and Use System Documentation
man pages
$apropos <search word> # search for evrything
$info <search word> # simlar to man pages, not the same
$cd usr/share/doc # info abour installed packages

 - Manage Access to the Root Account
$whoami # current user
$who # list of all users currently logged in to the machine
$su # change to super user (root) priviliges in the ordinary user shell (environment) - if installing a program that way the ordinary
user may get some permissions that he will normally not get if the install is under $su -
$su - # change to su in su shell
$su <user> # switch to other user
$sudo <command> # execute just one command as root (asks for current user pass, not root pass), easy to disable root privileges for a 
user form sudoers file - if all user use su instead of sudo, admin will need to renew root password when a user is to be 
stripped of his root acces
$sudo visudo # edit sudoers file
$groups # in which groups is the current user
$groups <user>
$id # view numerical IDs associated with each group for the current user
$getent group # view all groups on a system
$usermod -a -G <group> <user> # add a group to user - there is usually a group that gives root rights to its members (wheel in debian,
sudoers in ubuntu, etc.); usually needs re-logging to take effect
$sudo !! # execute previous command as sudo


	- Misc

df -h # (disk free) the drives that are mounted(some are virtual - in ram, created for processes)
chmod 1 - x, 2 - w, 3 - wx, 4 - r, 5 - rx, 6 -rw, 7 - rwx
tar- tape archive (to store on magnetic tape) 
TCP - protocol that allows multilayer connectivity between a client and a web server (which may have many different services),
IP protocol allows only a client to connect to a server; TCP allows for simultaneous connections on different ports to use different 
services of a server - common ports - 80 web server, 25 mail server, 22 ssh; for instance a client may open several connections on 
port 80 to download different parts of a webpage in order to show the webpage faster
search in man pages once inside a particular command:
/ search word
n - go to next result
shift + n - go back one result
compress directory - use tar command as direct gzip is for files only
$gzip -r directory_name - that will compress each file in the directory separately
rename file - with mv
hard link - a file is actually a link pointing to where in the hdd is written the info in the file; we can have several hard
links to the same file, editing hard link edits the original file, renaming a hard link does not affect other hard links to  the same file
soft link - a symbolic link to a file name; changing the hard link name will break the soft link 
awk???
